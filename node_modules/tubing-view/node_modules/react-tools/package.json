Here is the first one to get you started:\n\n```js\n/** @jsx React.DOM */\nvar HelloMessage = React.createClass({\n  render: function() {\n    return <div>{'Hello ' + this.props.name}</div>;\n  }\n});\n\nReact.renderComponent(\n  <HelloMessage name=\"John\" />,\n  document.getElementById('container')\n);\n```\n\nThis example will render \"Hello John\" into a container on the page.\n\nYou'll notice that we used an XML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/syntax.html). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. A simple transform is included with React that allows converting JSX into native JavaScript for browsers to digest.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe fastest way to get started is to serve JavaScript from the CDN:\n\n```html\n<!-- The core React library -->\n<script src=\"http://fb.me/react-0.4.0.min.js\"></script>\n<!-- In-browser JSX transformer, remove when pre-compiling JSX. -->\n<script src=\"http://fb.me/JSXTransformer-0.4.0.js\"></script>\n```\n\nWe've also built a [starter kit](http://facebook.github.io/react/downloads/react-0.4.0.zip) which might be useful if this is your first time using React. It includes a webpage with an example of using React with live code.\n\nIf you'd like to use [bower](http://bower.io), it's as easy as:\n\n```sh\nbower install --save react\n```\n\n## Contribute\n\nThe main purpose of this repository is to continue to evolve React core, making it faster and easier to use. If you're interested in helping with that, then keep reading. If you're not interested in helping right now that's ok too :) Any feedback you have about using React would be greatly appreciated.\n\n### Building Your Copy of React\n\nThe process to build `react.js` is built entirely on top of node.js, using many libraries you may already be familiar with.\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n* You have `node` installed at v0.10.0+ (it might work at lower versions, we just haven't tested).\n* You are familiar with `npm` and know whether or not you need to use `sudo` when installing packages globally.\n* You are familiar with `git`.\n\n#### Build\n\nOnce you have the repository cloned, building a copy of `react.js` is really easy.\n\n```sh\n# grunt-cli is needed by grunt; you might have this installed already\nnpm install -g grunt-cli\nnpm install\ngrunt build\n```\n\nAt this point, you should now have a `build/` directory populated with everything you need to use React. The examples should all work.\n\n### Grunt\n\nWe use grunt to automate many tasks. Run `grunt -h` to see a mostly complete listing. The important ones to know:\n\n```sh\n# Create test build & run tests with PhantomJS\ngrunt test\n# Lint the core library code with JSHint\ngrunt lint\n# Lint package code\ngrunt lint:package\n# Wipe out build directory\ngrunt clean\n```\n\n### Moreâ€¦\n\nThere's only so much we can cram in here.
